## The Aim:
The database has been populated with epigraphic data from a geographic area broadly conceived as falling within Ancient Thrace in a manner that crosses national and linguistic boundaries, and with an emphasis on the spatio-temporal attributes of individual inscriptions. The database makes possible the quantified analysis of more than 4600 inscriptions and their attributes, and is available for use and reuse by other scholars in epigraphy, philology, archaeology and other disciplines.
The data has been primarily collected for the PhD project _Hellenisation of Ancient Thrace_ based at Charles University, conducted by Petra Janouchová.

## Structure of the repository:
* Appendices - the appendices with the result of analyses generated for the dissertation submitted at the Charles University in Prague (mostly in Czech, but English one will be added)
* CSV Data Export - CSVs with raw data as exported from Heurist Scholar
* PostgreSQL - raw data and scripts enabling to recreate a data structure in PostgreSQL database
* R - R scripts with data analysis and results
* Shapefiles - geospatial data, transformed from the raw data to the form of shapefile, ready to be use by GIS software, or plotted on the map
* Temporal Animation - Carto.com timeline presentation of dated inscriptions, the CSVs containing date and spatial information for all inscriptions, and Python script reshaping the data to the required format, written by Brian Ballsun-Stanton

## Dissertation:
* the link to the text of the dissertation, typesetted with ConTeXt https://github.com/petrajanouchova/dis_context
* Defense 14 Dec 2017 in Czech, English version is scheduled for 2018
